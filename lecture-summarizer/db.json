    "Every action or every in action has a cost and that you could be doing something else instead. Everything you do has a next best alternative you could have done instead and that is called the opportunity cost. Paul Samuelson in the nineteen forties and fifties who wrote the fundamental textbook dog  give birth to modern economics because he was here and applied the kind of engineering principles of MIT to develop the field of modern economics what we'll learn today with developed at MIT so it's a great place to be learning it off now with that as background let's turn to our for the 1st model will talk about this semester which is the supply and demand model.",
    "The first and most important level is the intuitive level of understanding and the third is mathematical. The goal is to have you understand it at three levels. Adam Smith is sort of considered the father of economics home The Sims the father. of modern economics a dismiss the. father of all economics. The Sims is considered the best example brought up by Adam Smith by using the famous example. of the water Diamond Paradox was the water. Diamond Paradox. Adam Smith started one of his most famous examples of the. supply and demand model by using. the famous. example brought. up by. using the. famous example of the supply and. demand model.",
    "Adam Smith developed what we call the supply and demand scissors to explain the real world phenomenon we see like the fact that water is cheap and diamonds are expensive. Adam Smith asked will the answer he post is that what I first described was just demand that is we demand lots of water we demand fewer diamonds but we have to match that wage. The supply of water is almost infinite while the supply of diamonds maybe not naturally maybe it's through decisions of various businesses so basically what what what he developed is  what we have here this is the kind of XY graph took at all throughout the semester okay on the x-axis is the quantity of roses  on the y axis is the price of roses.",
    "Adam Smith's Adam Smith supply and demand model is the one point where both consumers and producers are happy to make a transaction. The point at which you're both willing to make that transaction appointment they're both satisfied with that transaction is the equilibrium wage which in this case is $3 per Rose and 600 roses. Now this raises lots of questions where the Kurds come from how does that cool Lebron get achieved why the heck do we give roses these are a bunch of questions we will we all will come to all these questions over the next set of lectures but the basic thing is to understand this intuition of Adam Smith.",
    "Thousands of people die every year because there's a waiting list for a kidney transplant. Congress would say look here's a transaction make both parties better off  the person who gets the kid who gets to stay alive and they're what they're willing to pay a huge amount for that. Many of these people are poor  and lives can be changed by being paid a million dollars for their kidney and might be happy to take the risk that there are other that one kidney will be fine is it is for most everyone for most of their life and return for having a life-changing payment from a stranger."
