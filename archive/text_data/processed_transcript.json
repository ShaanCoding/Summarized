["that we them the first we which be that every action or every in action have a cost and that you could be do something else instead okay so if you buy a shirt you could have buy pant", "if you sit at home and watch t you could have be out work everything you do have a next best alternative you could have do instead and that be call the opportunity cost okay and that be a critical in economics and that be why in some sense we be call refer to casually as the dismal science economics refer to as the dismal science first of all i be flatter where consumer science board call the dismal science because our whole point be that nothing be free there be always a trade off there be always an opportunity cost anything you do you could be do something else instead okay and you be constrain optimization mean you be go to have to pass up one thing to do another now some may call it dismal but as a former undergraduate i call it fun and this be why i think be the birthplace we economics because engineering be all about constrain optimization that be what engineer be an economics just the engine be just the you learn you learn engineer", "apply in different contexts so there be if we think about the two double o seven contest that still exist with the robots to double o7 yeah okay the two double o seven contest do your nose a contest be give a limit set of materials you have to build a robot that do some task like push ping pong ball off the table or something like that okay that be just constrain optimization it be get nothing to do with economics but it be constrain optimization so just think of this think of microeconomics as like engineer but actually interest okay so i think a micro economics as engineer but instead of office build something to push a ping pong ball off table you actually build people be live and businesses and understand the decisions that drive our economy okay so the same that you could think of for engineer class but take two people be live and that be why in fact modern economics be bear in this room this room or 26 100 okay by paul samuelson in the nineteen forties and fifties who write the fundamental dog", "give birth to modern economics because he be here and apply the kind of engineer of to actually develop the field of modern economics what we will learn today with develop at so it be a great place to be learn it off now with that as background ten question about that about what be microeconomics", "okay with that as background let be turn to our for the 1st will talk about this semester which be the supply and demand", "supply and demand now the way we be go to proceed in this cource", "he be go to drive you crazy", "because we be go to proceed by very the very first question point out by very simplify okay we be go to essentially what be a a be technically description between any two or more economic variables or any two or more variables okay but unlike the use all your other class these be not laws by and large they be so we do have a relationship between energy and mass which you can write down to law and we be do we have which be never a hundred percent true but always pretty true pretty be somewhere between ten and 95 true okay so basically the idea be to make a trade off we to write down in our to set of simplify assumptions that allow us with a birth family small set of step to capture relatively broad phenomena", "okay so it be essentially trade off on the one hand we would like a that capture as well as possible the phenomenon the real world like equal m c square but we to do so in the most tractable possible way so that we can it from first and not you know do not eat do not eat an hour to every single every single insight we have lunch okay so basically in economics we tend to resolve that by air on the side of tractability that be why i can you the entire field of microeconomics which be really sort of macros kind of a fun application micros really economics okay could you to the fire fill a microeconomic say a semester because we be go to make a whole huge set of simplify assumptions to make things tractable", "but the key thing be that you will be amaze at what these will be able to do with a fairly simple set of really able to offer insights and explain a whole huge variety of phenom never perfectly but always pretty well generally pretty well okay and so that be essentially the trade off we be go to try to do this semester so the line i like be this the status of george box say that all be wrong but some be useful now obviously do not apply to and in the hard sciences but in the social sciences that be true and baseball i be go to write down a set of like that now that remodel i write down i be go to try my goal be to have you understand it at three level", "the first and most important level be the intuitive level okay the level which you sort of understand i call it pass them on test you can go home and explain to your mom and thanksgiving or at the semester okay no offense to dad be just call them on test okay so basically that be the intuitive level you really understand it way that you could explain it the second be graphical we be go to do most of our here will develop in a graphical framework okay use x y graph that we be really be any economics we think deliver a lot of shorthand power and the third be mathematical okay the mathematical be probably the least important but it be easy to test you on so we be go to to know things mathematically as well okay so let be start by consider the supply and demand by use the famous example bring up by adam smith adam smith be sort of consider the father of economics home", "the sims the father of modern economics a dismiss the father of all economics his 1776 book the wealth of nations do an incredible job of actually lay out the entire core of economics fill with no math just word but kind of he just nail it and he start one of his most famous examples be the water diamond paradox okay he say think about water and diamonds it start with water bath nothing be more important for life than water it be a build block of all of life okay even when we look for life on other planets so we start by look for water now think of diamonds one of the more frivolous things you can buy certainly iraq into lead a successful or happy or productive life or any life okay yet for most of us waters free and diamonds be super expensive okay this be adam smith ask will the answer he post be that what i first describe be just demand that be we demand lot of water we demand few diamonds but we have to match that wage", "the of supply okay and the supply of water be almost infinite while the supply of diamonds maybe not naturally maybe it be through decisions of various businesses but it be somewhat limit okay so basically what what he develop be what we call the supply and demand scissor that you can not just think of supply and demand in isolation you have to put them together if you to explain the real world phenomenon we see like the fact that water be cheap and diamonds be expensive so let be just talk let be talk about an example so there be one graph do head out in the back okay which be let be talk about the market for roses", "okay so in the market for roses we have a demand curve and a supply curve so what we have here this be the kind of xy graph take at all throughout the semester okay on the x axis be the quantity of roses", "on the y axis be the price of roses", "the blue downward slop line be the demand curve now what i be go to do here i be just give you a overview we be go to we be go over the next six like five or six lecture dive into where this demand curve from okay we will go to first and build it back up but for now we drive a demand curve be it simply represent the relationship between the price of a good and how much people it off", "therefore we assume it be downward slop at high price people less of the good and we will just we will derive where that from shortly start next lecture but for now i think it be pretty ineffective then if the price of roses hire people few of them and that be why it be downward slop okay that basically have the price of roses go up people few roses", "the yellow curve be the supply curve now after we have derive the demand curve will then go and about twelve lecture to ride and supply curve that be a bite hard but once again will start from first and build it up for now you just to know be that be how much firm be will to supply give the price so basically as the price go up firm to produce more roses okay the high price mean you make money so you to produce more of them this be a slightly less intuitive than demand but will derive and explain how it can be but for now just go with the basic intuition that if you be make something and you can sell the mark up price you be go to to make more of it okay and that lead the upward slop supply curve where the point meet be the market equilibrium", "we be supply and demand meet be the market or calibri mm okay in that be the point where both consumers and producers be happy to make a transaction", "consumers be happy because they be on their demand curve be two point six hundred be the point three dollars and six hundred roses that be they be will to buy 600 row of 3 month", "okay producer happy cuz on their supply curve as the same point they be will to supply 600 row of 3 that be the one point where consumers be happy and proof be happy there for its equilibrium highly non technical but that be the basic intuition okay the point at which you be both will to make that transaction appointment they be both satisfy with that transaction be the equilibrium wage which in this case be 3 per rose and 600 roses", "now this lot of question where the kurds from how do that cool lebron get achieve why the heck do we give roses these be a bunch of question we will we will all will to all these question over the next set of lecture but the basic thing be to understand this intuition of adam smith supply and demand", "ok question about that", "okay now this also another important distinction that will focus on the semester be easy to get mix up so i you to if you be ever unclaimed that what you ask me about it and that be a suggestion between positive", "positive versa be normative", "analyse positive vs normative positive analysis be the study of the way things be while normative analysis be the be the study of the way things should be a positive analysis the study the way things be while normative analysis be the study of the way things should be", "let me give you a great example which be auction okay auction be a terrific example there like the example of a competitive market she can seat your head demand a bunch of people go on and bid people it more bid more so you actually get a demand curve the high the price the few people be get you be get to bid supply be how many how much how many units of it be for sale on", "you do until those to meet and then you have a market like librium at that bidded price okay now one one example auction that get a lot of attention and number of years ago early in the days of be someone offer their kidney for auction they say look i get you kidneys you will one to live there people out there a kidney i be push kidney on for auction and what bid go nut it start at 25 000 it climb to five million before the auction be shut down decide they would not allow you to sell your body on bodily part on okay so this two question the first be the positive question why do the price up so high", "so what be the answer to that what be the answer to the positive question", "okay let be look good answer but let be let be hand and give a f that be part of it yeah", "those be quite high demand demand be incredibly high cuz i die without it supply be low cuz like not all of us be will to sell their kidneys on okay so low supply high demand lead to a high price and smith at work that be the positive analysis okay but this the north but then there be the normative question which be should you be allow to sell your kidneys on wage that be the normative question the positive question be what if you do the normal question be should you", "now the standard economics censor to start would be of course you should", "we be in a world where thousands of people die every year because there be a wait list for a kidney transplant okay and these be people who would happily pay a lot of money to stay alive or presume okay meanwhile there be hundreds of millions of people walk around with two kidneys go only one", "and many of these people be poor", "and live can be change by be pay a million dollars for their kidney and might be happy to take the risk that there be other that one kidney will be fine be it be for most everyone for most of their life and return for have a life change payment from a strange so the congress would say look here be a transaction make both party good off", "the person who get the kid who get to stay alive and they be what they be will to pay a huge amount for that the person who sell the kidney in most probability be fine cuz almost all of us can make it through life fine with one kidney and to get a life change amount of money that could allow them to pursue their dream in various ways okay so that be the standard argument would be yeah you should be able to sell your kidneys on okay so the question be why not why would we to stop this transaction what be the counter arguments to that let be their rat yeah i be actually like i think maybe she be like because of there be no way to regulate it or like you do not like necessarily know like people could be like sell treat kidney per right so the first type of problem the category we call market failures", "market failures be reason why the market do not work in the wonderful way economist like to think it should", "so for example this answer put up that could be the problem of a fraud", "okay people might not be able to tell if there get a legit kidney or not okay there could be the example of imperfect information", "do you know what the odds be that you can the rest of your life with only one kidney i do not either okay we ought to know that before we start sell our kidneys okay there could be imperfect information off okay these be the kinds of this be one type of problem which be the market maybe the market may fail okay yeah our current system also help people who be poor and have availability and which would be which be people who become pretty screw i do not anything right pose wage a second problem be what we call equity or fairness", "equity or fairness which be we would end up with a world where only rich people would get kidneys okay currently there be a bunch of voluntary donors and people who be in fact of kidneys leftover okay and those go to a people on the basis of where they be in a waitlist actually prioritize wait unless it be kind of a cool one of my colleagues nikhil agarwal if you think about i will talk a lot this semester off about the imperialistic view of economics all the cool things we can study so he actually use economic to study the optimal way to organs to individuals right now it be just do base on a wait list", "but but it may be that someone further down the wait list it more than someone high up the wait list because they be more critical or whatever so it be various often ways to but certainly out the way okay would not be the rich guy get at first i would be unlikely to be what society would necessarily so it be an equity concern with that what else", "what other yea", "really say you know you can make money off of sell candy and they figure out of the people on there the black market for kidneys right so there be sort of a third it be relate to fraud purchase of a third class of failures that get into the question about behavioral economics we that be early which we could just cost a behavioral fail behavioral just call back and ask for one of the good term which be essentially people do not always make decisions in the perfectly rational logical way we will them as do so this semester", "people make mistake that be a word we hate use economic so he be say mistake booboo mistake nobody make mistake we be all perfect little economically be but we know that be not true increasingly over the past several decades economist have start incorporate insights from psychology into our", "to not just say people make mistake that the lackadaisical but rigorously the nature of those mistake and understand how mistake can actually due to various cognitive bias among other things in this world you can imagine people could make mistake they could be they could not really sit down and quite understand what they be do and they could have cell in their kidney when it be really not in their own long term interest ya dead and will be like as i be like a lot of family live like an extreme poverty like even though they only have one kitty they my soul the other one particular money for the family per well i mean it be subsets that would be once again if we take this factor out we take if we take if we take the market work well be no behavioral effect we would say well you know that be their decision you know if they otherwise they starve who be you to say", "okay but once you choose this say well make a second maybe the nada value in the trade off correctly even if there be no fraud even if it be perfect information they may not have to process that information correctly okay but that be not economics that be not what we a lot of time in the semester but it be obviously realistic okay so those be a bunch of good comment great comment"]
