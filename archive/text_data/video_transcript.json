    "concept that we teach them the first concept we teach which is that every action or every in action has a cost and that you could be doing something else instead okay so if you buy a shirt you could have bought pants",
    " if you sit at home and watch t you could have been out working everything you do has a next best alternative you could have done instead and that is called the opportunity cost okay and that's a critical Concept in economics and that is why in some sense we are called referred to casually as the Dismal science economics referred to as the Dismal science first of all I'm flattered where consumer science board called the Dismal science because our whole point is that nothing is free there's always a trade-off there's always an opportunity cost anything you do you could be doing something else instead okay and you're constrained optimization means you're going to have to pass up one thing to do another now some may call it dismal but as a former MIT undergraduate I call it fun and this is why I think MIT is the birthplace we teach economics because MIT Engineering is all about constrained optimization that's what engineering is an economics just the engine is just the principles you learn you learn engineering",
    " applied in different contexts so there's if we think about the two double o seven contests that still exists with the robots to double O7 yeah okay the two double o seven contests does your nose a contest were given a limited set of materials you have to build a robot that does some tasks like pushing ping pong balls off the table or something like that okay that's just constrained optimization it's got nothing to do with economics but it's constrained optimization so just think of this think of microeconomics as like engineering but actually interesting okay so I think a micro economics as engineering but instead of office building something to push a ping pong ball off tables you actually build people's lives and businesses and understand the decisions that drive our economy okay so the same principles that you could think of for engineering classes but took two people's lives and that's why in fact modern economics was born in this room this room or 26 100 okay by Paul Samuelson in the nineteen forties and fifties who wrote the fundamental textbook dog",
    " give birth to modern economics because he was here and applied the kind of engineering principles of MIT to actually develop the field of modern economics what we'll learn today with developed at MIT so it's a great place to be learning it off now with that as background ten questions about that about what is microeconomics",
    " okay with that as background let's turn to our for the 1st model will talk about this semester which is the supply and demand model",
    " supply-and-demand now the way we're going to proceed in this cource",
    " he's going to drive you crazy",
    " because we're going to proceed by teaching very the very first question pointed out by teaching very simplified models okay we're going to essentially what is a Model A model is technically description between any two or more economic variables or any two or more variables okay but unlike the models using all your other classes these aren't laws by and large they're models so we do have a relationship between energy and mass which you can write down to law and we're done we have models which are never a hundred percent true but always pretty true pretty being somewhere between ten and 95% true okay so basically the idea is to make a trade-off we want to write down in our models to set of simplifying assumptions that allow us with a birth family small set of steps to capture relatively broad phenomena",
    " okay so it's essentially trade-off on the one hand we'd like a model that captures as well as possible the phenomenon the real world like equals m c squared but we want to do so in the most tractable possible way so that we can teach it from first principles and not you know don't eat don't eat an hour to teach every single every single Insight we have lunch okay so basically in economics we tend to resolve that by airing on the side of tractability that is why I can teach you the entire field of microeconomics which is really sort of macros kind of a fun application micros really economics okay could you to the fire filled a microeconomic said a semester because we're going to make a whole huge set of simplifying assumptions to make things tractable",
    " but the key thing is that you will be amazed at what these models will be able to do with a fairly simple set of models really able to offer insights and explain a whole huge variety of Phenom never perfectly but always pretty well generally pretty well okay and so that is essentially the trade-off we're going to try to do this semester so the line I like is this the status of George box said that all models are wrong but some are useful now obviously doesn't apply to models models and in the hard Sciences but in the social sciences that's true and baseball I'm going to write down a set of models like that now that remodel I write down I'm going to try my goal is to have you understand it at three levels",
    " the first and most important level is the intuitive level okay the level which you sort of understand I call it passing them on tests you can go home and explain to your mom and Thanksgiving or at the semester okay no offense to Dad's just called them on tests okay so basically that's the intuitive level you really understand it way that you could explain it the second is graphical we were going to do most of our models here will develop in a graphical framework okay using X Y graphs that we're really is any economics we think delivers a lot of shorthand power and the third is mathematical okay the mathematical is probably the least important but it's easiest to test you on so we're going to need to know things mathematically as well okay so let's start by considering the supply and demand model by using the famous example brought up by Adam Smith Adam Smith is sort of considered the father of economics home",
    " The Sims the father of modern economics a dismiss the father of all economics his 1776 book The Wealth of Nations did an incredible job of actually laying out the entire core of Economics filled with no math just words but kind of he just nailed it and he started one of his most famous examples was the water Diamond Paradox okay he said think about water and diamonds it start with water bath nothing is more important for life than water it's a building block of all of life okay even when we look for life on other planets so we start by looking for water now think of diamonds one of the more frivolous things you can buy certainly Iraq into leading a successful or happy or productive life or any life okay yet for most of us Waters free and diamonds are super expensive okay. This be Adam Smith asked will the answer he post is that what I first described was just demand that is we demand lots of water we demand fewer diamonds but we have to match that wage",
    " the concept of Supply okay and the supply of water is almost infinite while the supply of diamonds maybe not naturally maybe it's through decisions of various businesses but it's somewhat limited okay so basically what what he developed is what we call the supply and demand scissors that you can't just think of supply and demand in isolation you have to put them together if you want to explain the real world phenomenon we see like the fact that water is cheap and diamonds are expensive so let's just talk let's talk about an example so there's one graph does headed out in the back okay which is let's talk about the market for roses",
    " okay so in the market for Roses we have a demand curve and a supply curve so what we have here this is the kind of XY graph took at all throughout the semester okay on the x-axis is the quantity of roses",
    " on the y axis is the price of roses.",
    " the blue downward-sloping line is the demand curve now what I'm going to do here I'm just giving you a overview we're going to we are going over the next six like five or six lectures dive into where this demand curve comes from. Okay we'll go to First principles and build it back up but for now we drove a demand curve is it simply represents the relationship between the price of a good and how much people want it off",
    " therefore we assume it is downward-sloping at higher prices people want less of the good and we'll just we'll derive where that comes from shortly starting next lecture but for now I think it's pretty ineffective then if the price of roses hire people want fewer of them and that's why it's downward-sloping okay that basically has the price of roses goes up people want fewer roses",
    " the yellow curve is the supply curve now after we've derived the demand curve will then go and spend about twelve lectures to ride and supply curve that's a bit harder but once again will start from first principles and build it up for now you just need to know is that's how much firms are willing to supply given the price so basically as the price goes up firms want to produce more roses okay the higher price means you make money so you want to produce more of them this is a slightly less intuitive than demand but will derive and explain how it can be but for now just go with the basic intuition that if you're making something and you can sell the mark-up price you're going to want to make more of it okay and that leads the upward-sloping supply curve where the points meet is the market equilibrium",
    " we're supply and demand meets is the market or calibri mm okay in that is the point where both consumers and producers are happy to make a transaction",
    " consumers are happy because they are on their demand curve is two point six hundred is the point three dollars and six hundred roses that is they are willing to buy 600 rows of $3 month",
    " okay producer happy cuz on their supply curve as the same point they are willing to supply 600 rows of $3 that is the one point where consumers are happy and proofs are happy there for its equilibrium highly non-technical but that's the basic intuition okay the point at which you're both willing to make that transaction appointment they're both satisfied with that transaction is the equilibrium wage which in this case is $3 per Rose and 600 roses",
    " now this raises lots of questions where the Kurds come from how does that cool Lebron get achieved why the heck do we give roses these are a bunch of questions we will we will all will come to all these questions over the next set of lectures but the basic thing is to understand this intuition of Adam Smith supply and demand model",
    " OK questions about that",
    " okay now this model also raises another important distinction that will focus on the semester is easy to get mixed up so I want you to if you're ever unclaimed that what you asked me about it and that's a suggestion between positive",
    " positive versa's normative",
    " analyses positive vs. normative positive analysis is the study of the way things are while normative analysis are the is the study of the way things should be a positive analysis the study the way things are while normative analysis is the study of the way things should be",
    " let me give you a great example which is eBay auctions okay auctions are a terrific example there like the textbook example of a competitive market she can seat your head demand comes a bunch of people going on and bidding people want it more bid more so you actually get a demand curve the higher the price the fewer people are getting you're getting to bid Supply is how many how much how many units of it are for sale on eBay",
    " you did until those to meet and then you have a market like Librium at that bidded price okay now one one example eBay auction that got a lot of attention and number of years ago early in the days of eBay was someone offered their kidney for auction they said look I got you kidneys you'll need one to live there people out there need a kidney I'm pushing kidney on eBay for auction and what happened bidding went nuts it started at 25,000 it climbed to five million before the auction was shut down eBay decided they wouldn't allow you to sell your body on eBay bodily parts on eBay okay so this raises two questions the first is the positive question why did the price up so high",
    " so what's the answer to that what's the answer to the positive questioned",
    " okay let's look good answer but let's let's raise hands and give a f that's part of it yeah",
    " those are quite high demand demand is incredibly High cuz I die without it Supply is low cuz like not all of us are willing to sell their kidneys on eBay okay so low supply high demand led to a high price and Smith at work that's the positive analysis okay but this raises the north but then there's the normative question which is should you be allowed to sell your kidneys on eBay wage that's the normative question the positive question is what happens if you do the normal question is should you",
    " now the standard economics censor to start would be of course you should",
    " we're in a world where thousands of people die every year because there's a waiting list for a kidney transplant okay and these are people who would happily pay a lot of money to stay alive or presume okay meanwhile there's hundreds of millions of people walking around with two kidneys go only need one",
    " and many of these people are poor",
    " and lives can be changed by being paid a million dollars for their kidney and might be happy to take the risk that there are other that one kidney will be fine is it is for most everyone for most of their life and return for having a life-changing payment from a stranger so the Congress would say look here's a transaction make both parties better off",
    " the person who gets the kid who gets to stay alive and they're what they are willing to pay a huge amount for that the person who sells the kidney in most probability is fine cuz almost all of us can make it through life fine with one kidney and to get a life-changing amount of money that could allow them to pursue their dreams in various ways okay so that's the standard argument would be yeah you should be able to sell your kidneys on eBay okay so the question is why not why would we want to stop this transaction what are the counter-arguments to that let's raise their rates yeah I'm actually like I think maybe she was like because of eBay there's no way to regulate it or like you don't like necessarily know like people could be like selling treat kidney per se right so the first type of problem, the category we call market failures",
    " market failures are reasons why the market doesn't work in the wonderful way Economist liked to think it should",
    " so for example this answer puts up that could be the problem of a fraud",
    " okay people might not be able to tell if there getting a legit kidney or not okay there could be the example of imperfect information",
    " do you know what the odds are that you can spend the rest of your life with only one kidney I don't either okay we ought to know that before we start selling our kidneys okay there could be imperfect information off okay these are the kinds of this is one type of problem which is the market maybe the market May Fail okay yeah our current system also help people who are poor and have availability and which would be which are people who become pretty screwed I don't want anything right poses wage a second problem is what we call Equity or fairness",
    " Equity or fairness which is we would end up with a world where only rich people would get kidneys okay currently there's a bunch of voluntary donors and people who are in fact of kidneys leftover okay and those go to a people on the basis of where they are in a waitlist actually prioritize wait unless it's kind of a cool one of my colleagues nikhil Agarwal if you think about I'll talk a lot this semester off about the imperialistic view of Economics all the cool things we can study so he actually uses economic models to study the optimal way to allocate organs to individuals right now it's just done based on a waiting list",
    " but but it may be that someone further down the waiting list needs it more than someone higher up the waiting list because they're more critical or whatever so it's various often ways to allocate but certainly out the way. Okay wouldn't be the rich guy gets at first I would be unlikely to be what society would necessarily want so it's an equity concern with that what else",
    " what other yea",
    " really says you know you can make money off of selling candy and they figured out of the people on there. The black market for kidneys right so there's sort of a third it's related to fraud purchase of a third class of failures that gets into the question about behavioral economics we taught that was raised earlier which we could just costs a behavioral failing behavioral just call back and ask for one of the better term which is essentially people don't always make decisions in the perfectly rational logical way we will model them as doing so this semester",
    " people make mistakes that's a word we hate using economic so he's saying mistakes Booboo mistakes nobody makes mistakes we're all perfect little economically beings but we know that's not true increasingly over the past several decades Economist has started incorporating insights from psychology into our models",
    " to not just say people make mistakes that the lackadaisical but rigorously model the nature of those mistakes and understand how mistakes can actually happen due to various cognitive bias among other things in this world you can imagine people could make mistakes they could be they could not really sit down and quite understand what they're doing and they could have cell in their kidney when it's really not in their own long-term interest Ya Dead and will be like as I was like a lot of family lives like an extreme poverty like even though they only have one kitty they my soul the other one particular money for the family per se well I mean it's subsets that would be once again. If we took this factor out we took if we took if we took the market works well is no behavioral effects we'd say well you know that's their decision you know if they otherwise they starve who are you to say",
    " okay but once you choose this say well made a second maybe the NADA value in the trade-offs correctly even if there's no fraud even if it's perfect information they may not have to process that information correctly okay but that is not economics that's not what we spend a lot of time in the semester but it's obviously realistic okay so those are a bunch of good comments great comments"
